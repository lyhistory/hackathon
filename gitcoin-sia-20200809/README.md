I'm from China, and working in Singapore as a normal IT Engineer, started from investing on cryptos a few years ago, gradually I self-learned some development skills on blockchain and then participated in an opensource  project alphawallet and created some poc for it, currrently I've shifted most my time on web security pentest,  but I still keep some of my time on blockahin, mostly reading twitter news, that's how I know this hackathon
